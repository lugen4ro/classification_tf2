This repository contains various image classification models and the necessary code to train, evaluate and run inference on those.

To Do:
- Image Preprocessing Difference on Results
-- Normalization
-- Photometric Distortions
-- Geometric Distortions
- Loss Function Difference on Results (L2,L1,Huber etc.)

(Also for Object Detection)
